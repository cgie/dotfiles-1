# Copy an existing CDROM into a new ISO-9660 image:
mkisofs -r -o /fully-qualified-file-name-of-iso-image.iso /dev/cdrom

# Copy a directory tree from the hard drive into an ISO image (but probably not compatible with MS DOS): (Better for Linux backup as hidden files beginning with "." and long file names are preserved.)
mkisofs -r -R -J -l -L -o /fully-qualified-file-name-of-iso-image.iso /name-of-directory-containing-files-to-format-into-iso-image

# mkisofs options:

    Command Option 	Description
    -b 	Specifies the path and filename of the boot image to be used when making an "El Torito" bootable CD.
    The pathname must be relative to the source path specified to mkisofs.
    Required to make a bootable CD. The boot image must be exactly the size of either a 1.2, 1.44, or a 2.88 meg floppy.
    -c 	Specifies the path and filename of the boot catalog to be used when making a bootable CD.
    The pathname must be relative to the source path specified to mkisofs.
    -l 	Allow 31 character file names. CD will not be 8.3 DOS compatible. (Who cares! Thus use this option.)
    -o 	Name of iso9660 output image file
    -r 	Set file permissions on CD to be publicly readable
    -v 	Verbose execution.
    -x 	Exclude given path from being written to CDROM.
    -A 	Text string that will be written into the volume header
    -J 	Generate Joliet directory records in addition to regular iso9660 file names.
    This preserves the case (upper/lower) of file and directory names. Useful for use with MS/Windows environments.
    -L
    -allow-leading-dots 	Allows files to begin with "." (period). Use this option to write Unix/Linux hidden files. CD will not be DOS compatible. (Who cares! Thus use this option.)
    -allow-multidot 	Allows files to contain multiple "."s (periods). Use this option to write Unix/Linux files which may contain more than one period. CD will not be DOS compatible. (Who cares! Thus use this option.)
    -R 	Add Rock Ridge records to further describe the files. Preserves filename length and case.
    -V 	Specifies the volume ID to be written into the master block.
    -T 	Generate a file TRANS.TBL in each directory.
    -graft-points 	Translate a directory to the root ("/") of the CD. See examples. (i.e.: -graft-points "/=DirectoryName/")
    -pad 	Default (not necessary to specify this option). Pads the end of the whole image by 150 sectors (300 kB). Avoids read ahead errors on last file.


$ mkisofs -o test.iso -Jrv -V test_disk /home/test/

In this example:

    * -o names the new .iso image file (test.iso)
    * -J uses Joliet naming records, for Windows compatibility
    * -r uses Rock Ridge naming conventions for UNIX/Linux compatibility, and makes all files publicly readable
    * -v sets verbose mode, for a running commentary as the image is created
    * -V provides a volume ID (test_disk); this is the disk name that shows up in Windows Explorer
    * Last in the list are the files selected for packaging into the .iso (everything in /home/carla/)
