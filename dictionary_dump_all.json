Synonyms Bent, Propensity, Bias, Inclination, Tendency, Proneness, Disposition, all keep more or less of their original figurativeness. Bent is the general and natural state of the mind as disposed toward something; a decided and fixed turning of the mind toward a particular object or mode of action. Propensity is less deep than bent, less a matter of the whole nature, and is often applied to a strong appetency toward that which is evil. Bias has often the same meaning as bent, but tends specially to denote a sort of external and continued action upon the mind: as, “morality influences men's minds and gives a bias to all their actions,” Locke. Bias is often little more than prejudice. Inclination is a sort of bent; a leaning, more or less decided, in some direction. Tendency is a little more than inclination, stronger and more permanent. Proneness is by derivation a downward tendency, a strong natural inclination toward that which is in some degree evil: as, proneness to err, to self-justification, to vice; but it is also used in a good sense. Disposition is often a matter of character, with more of choice in it than in the others, but it is used with freedom in lighter senses; as, the disposition to work; the disposition of a plant to climb.","n.

Specifically— A feeler; a tentacle; an antenna; an ovipositor; also, the tuft of feathers upon the head of sundry birds, resembling a horn; a plumicorn, as that of various owls.","n. A wind-instrument more or less resembling a horn in shape and size, and originally made of horn: as, a hunting-horn; a tin horn. In the simpler forms the horn is used chiefly to give signals, producing single or slightly variable loud tones. The hunting-horn, however, was early elaborated and made capable of producing a variety of calls, fanfares, and simple tnnes. Wood, ivory, and various metals have been used for making horns.","n. By extension, a musical wind-instrnment of the trumpet class, developed from the hunting-horn (previously modified for use in orchestras under the name corno di caccia), and distinctively called the French horn, having a slender tube of brass or silver, several feet long, gracefully curved upon itself, terminating in a flaring bell, and blown through a mouthpiece of conoidal bore. Its tones are harmonics of the natural tone of the tube, produced by slightly varying the method and pressure of the blowing. Its compass is about four octaves, the series of tones in the two upper octaves being diatonic and partially chromatic. In addition to these primary or open tones, modified or closed tones are produced by inserting the hand into the bell, so as to alter the pitch of an open tone chromatically. The pitch of the fundamental tone, and thus of the whole series of open tones, is altered by detachable crooks, which increase the actual length of the tube. From eight to twelve such crooks are made, pitching the instrument in nearly all the chromatic keys between the second C below middle C and the second Bb below that. The key in which the instrnment is to be set is indicated at the beginning of each piece; but the music is written in the key of C. The pitch of the tube is still further affected by the tuning-slide, which is one of the curves of the tube so arranged that it can be pushed in or out at will. Ventils or valves are sometimes added to the tube to facilitate rapid passages. Horns are the most valuable orchestral instruments of their class. Their tone is mellow, pervasive, and blending, with a peculiar romantic quality. The French horn is sometimes used singly or as a solo instrument, but in orchestras it is nearly always combined in pairs or in quartets, and used both for melodic effects, especially in fanfares and similar figures, and for sustained chords as a harmonic basis for free instrumentation.","n. A drinking-vessel of the shape of a horn or made of a horn. See drinking-horn.","n. A long projection, frequently of silver or gold, worn on the forehead by natives of some Asiatic countries.","n.

Funny is the weakest of the list, ranging from the meaning of ‘amusing’ or ‘odd’ down to its colloquial use in the sense of ‘strange.’ Comical still retains a faint suggestion of its origin in connection with the drama, being primarily used in connection with something done or seen, and hence something viewed by the mind: a comical predicament is just such as would be fit for exhibition in a comedy.

Ridiculous is the only word in the list that throws contempt or even discredit upon the person concerned: it is allowable to tell a ludicrous story about one's friend, but not a story that makes him appear ridiculous.

The act of repenting, or the state of being penitent; sorrow for what one has done or omitted to do; especially, contrition for sin.","n. The act of repenting; the state of being penitent; sorrow or contrition for what one has done or left undone.","n. In theology, a change of mental and spiritual habit respecting sin, involving a hatred of and sorrow because of it, and a hearty and genuine abandonment of it in conduct of life.","n. Synonyms Repentance, Penitence, Contrition, Compunction, Regret, Remorse, may express the sorrowful feeling of the wrong-doer in view of his conduct. Regret is quite as often used of wishing that one had not done that which is unwise; as applied to misconduct, it expresses the feeblest degree of sorrow for doing wrong; but it may contain no element of real repentance. Repentance goes beyond feeling to express distinct purposes of turning from sin to righteousness; the Bible word most often translated repentance means a change of mental and spiritual attitude toward sin. Strictly, repentance is the beginning of amendment of life; the word does not imply any greater degree of feeling than is necessary to bring about a change, whether the turning be from a particular sin or from an attitude of sin. Penitence implies a large measure of feeling, and applies more exclusively than repentance to wrong-doing as an offense against God and right. Contrition, literally breaking or bruising, is essentially the same as penitence; it is a deep, quiet, and continued sorrow, chiefly for specific acts. Compunction, literally pricking, is a sharp pang of regret or self-reproach, often momentary and not always resulting in moral benefit. It is more likely than remorse to result in good. Remorse, literally gnawing, is naturally sharper mental suffering than compunction; the word often suggests a sort of spiritual despair or hopelessness, paralyzing one for efforts to attain repentance.","n. remorse for your past conduct"],"Random":0.16356267}

These words are arranged in the order of their intensity and of their degrees of activity toward others. Gloomy has the figurative suggestion of physical gloom or darkness: the gloomy man has little brightness in his mind, or he sees little light ahead. The sullen man is silent because he is sluggishly angry and somewhat bitter, and he repels friendly advances by silence and a lowering aspect rather than by words. The sulky person persists in being sullen beyond all reason and for mere whim: the young are often sulky. In the morose man there is an element of hate, and he meets advances with rudeness or cruel words: the young have rarely development of character enough to be morose. The splenetic man is sulky and peevish, with frequent outbursts of irritation venting itself upon persons or things.

Its essential elements are a balanced piston, on one side of which is the pressure in the brake-pipe and on the other side the pressure in the auxiliary reservoir; a slide-valve, on top of which is the pressure in the auxiliary reservoir; and a graduating-valve, which opens or closes certain ports in the slide-valve. When charging the system, air from the brake-pipe passes through a feed-groove around the piston of the triple valve and so into the auxiliary reservoir, charging it with compressed air, the slide-valve meanwhile connecting the brake-cylinder to the exhaust port and atmosphere through ports in its face. When the pressure in the brake-pipe falls below that in the auxiliary reservoir, the balance of pressure on the piston is destroyed and the piston moves toward the now lower brake-pipe pressure, carrying with it the graduating- and slide-valves which cut off the auxiliary reservoir from the brake-pipe","n. cut off the brake-cylinder from the atmosphere, and","n. connect the auxiliary reservoir with the brake-cylinder, thus admitting compressed air to the brake-cylinder, which forces the piston in this cylinder outward, and, through the connecting levers and rods, sets the brake. For any definite reduction in brake-pipe pressure short of the point at which the brake-cylinder and auxiliary reservoir pressures equalize, the increase of brake-cylinder pressure continues until the auxiliary reservoir pressure falls slightly below that remaining in the brake-pipe when the triple-valve piston returns in the direction of the now lower auxiliary reservoir pressure, carrying with it the graduating-valve, until the latter cuts off the flow of air from the auxiliary reservoir to the brake-cylinder, when all communication through the triple valve is closed. When the pressure in the brake-pipe is then increased above that in the auxiliary reservoir sufficiently to overcome the resistance of both the piston and slide-valve, the parts return to their first position, charging the auxiliary reservoir anew and connecting the brake-cylinder to the atmosphere, which releases its charge and allows the release-springs to return its piston with the attached levers, rods, and brake-shoes to their original positions and releasing the shoes from the wheels. Various improved types of triple valves are now in use, providing for differentiating between service and emergency brake-cylinder pressures, for graduating the release of all brakes in the train, for a rapid serial service application of all the brakes in long trains, for uniform releasing and uniform recharging of all the brakes in long trains, and so on.","n.

In more recent use wit in the singular generally implies comic wit; in that sense it is different from humor. One principal difference is that wit always lies in some form of words, while humor may be expressed by manner, as a smile, a grimace, an attitude. Underlying this is the fact, consistent with the original meaning of the words, that humor goes more deeply into the nature of the thought, while wit catches pleasing but occult or farfetched resemblances between things really unlike: a good pun shows wit; Iiving's “History of New York” is a piece of sustained humor, the humor lying in the portrayal of character, the nature of the incidents, etc. Again, “Wit may, I think, be regarded as a purely intellectual process, while humor is a sense of the ridiculous controlled by feeling, and coexistent often with the gentlest and deepest pathos” (H. Reed, Lects. on Eng. Lit., xi. 357). Hence humor is always kind, while wit may be unkind in the extreme: Swift's “Travels of Gulliver” is much too severe a satire to be called a work of humor. It is essential to the effect of wit that the form in which it is expressed should be brief; humor may be heightened in its effect by expansion into full forms of statement, description, etc Wit more often than humor depends upon passing circumstances for its effect.","n.

See polar, n.","n. In a magnetic body, either of the two points about which two opposite magnetic forces are generally most intense. A line joining these points is called the magnetic axis, and generally a magnet may be considered as if the magnetic forces were concentrated at the extremity of this line. When a magnetic body is freely suspended, the magnetic axis assumes a direction parallel with the lines of force of the magnetic field in which it is. On the surface of the earth this direction is in a vertical plane approximately north and south, and that end of the magnet which points to the north is generally called the north pole or the north-seeking pole. The fact that the real magnetism of this pole is opposite in character to that of the north pole of the earth gives rise to some confusion in the nomenclature of the poles. Some physicists have used the epithets marked and unmarked to designate the north-seeking and south-seeking poles respectively. The words austral and boreal are also used. A magnet may have more than two poles, or points of maximum magnetic intensity, and in fact it may be assumed that all parts of a magnet are in a state of polarity, the actual poles of the magnet being the result of all polarization.","n.

In North America the chief regions in which it is produced commercially are the Eastern Canadian region, comprising parts of Ontario, Quebec, and the maritime provinces; the New England and New York region; the Piedmont region of Virginia; the Michigan-Ohio region; the prairie-plains region, from Indiana and Illinois to Missouri and Kansas, in which the Ben Davis variety is the leading factor; the Ozark region, comprising part of Missouri and Arkansas, often known as “the land of the big red apple”; and the rapidly developing regions of the Rocky Mountain States and the Coast States. In all these sections there are certain dominant varieties, which are usually less successful in other localities. As a country grows older, it usually, happens that the list of desirable apples increases in length, because of the choosing of varieties to suit special localities and special needs. It is impossible to give lists of varieties for planting in all parts of the country, either for market or home use. The number of varieties of apples runs into the thousands. A generation and more ago, the great emphasis in apple-growing was placed on varieties, and the old fruit-books testify to the great development of systematic pomology. The choice of varieties is not less important now; but other subjects have greatly increased in importance with the rise of commercial fruit-growing, such as the necessity and means of tilling the soil, fertilization and cover-cropping, the combating of insects and diseases (especially by means of spraying), and revised methods of handling, storing, and marketing. The result is the transfer of the emphasis to scientific and commercial questions. The apple has been generally referred to the rosaceous genus Pyrus, although some recent authors reinstate the old genus Malus. Under the former genus it is known as Pyrus Malus; under the latter as Malus Malus. The nearest generic allies are the pears, comprising the typical genus Pyrus. The pears are distinguished, among other things, by having the styles free to the base; the apples by having the styles more or less united below. The species Malus Malus has run into almost numberless forms under the influence of long domestication. These forms are distinguished not only by differences in fruit, but by habit of tree and marked botanical characteristics. Thus the bloomless apple (see seedless apple) has more or less diclinous flowers, and it was early described as a distinct species under the name of Pyrus dioica. There are many forms of dwarf apple-trees, the best-known of which is the paradise or garden-apple. On this and similar stocks any variety of apple may be grafted or budded if very small or dwarf trees are desired. There are apple-trees with variegated foliage, others with double flowers, and others with a weeping or drooping habit. In China and Japan there is a double-flowered and showy-flowered apple of a very closely allied but apparently distinct species, Malus spectabilis.
