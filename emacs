;;; This is a sample .emacs file.
;;;
;;; The .emacs file, which should reside in your home directory, allows you to
;;; customize the behavior of Emacs.  In general, changes to your .emacs file
;;; will not take effect until the next time you start up Emacs.  You can load
;;; it explicitly with `M-x load-file RET ~/.emacs RET'.
;;;
;;; There is a great deal of documentation on customization in the Emacs
;;; manual.  You can read this manual with the online Info browser: type
;;; `C-h i' or select "Emacs Info" from the "Help" menu.
